# Things to Learn by Heart as a Backend Engineer

# I. Computer Organization and Architecture

# II. Operating System

## Chapter 1

### 1. What?

- An Operating System is a System software that manages all the resources of the computing device.

### 2. Why?

- Resources needs to be managed
- Applications talk to the OS
- Most OSs are general purpose (EG: linux, window are different purpose)

#### Scheduling things

- scheduling is critical
- Fair share of resources to all processes (CPU, Memory, IO)
- Application works on any hardware
- Occasional breaking changes (64bit/32bit)
- Do we can build app without OS?

=> OS APIs abstracts the hardware -> Hide complexity
=> Understand OS that help we build efficient application.

### 3. OS Architecture Overview

#### System Architecture

- System has resources
- The Kernel is OS core component

#### CPU

- Central Processing Unit
- Consists of cores
- Each core has a clock speed
- Executes machine level instructions
- Fast cache

#### Memory

- Random Access Memory
- Fast but Volatile (loss the data)
- Store process states and data
- limited
- Slower than CPU cache

#### Storage

- Persisted storage
- HDD, SSD
- Slower than memory

#### Network

- Communicates with other hosts
- NIC (Network Interface Controller)
- Protocol implementations

#### Kernel

- The core of the OS
- Manages the resores
- The OS is more than the kenel. EG: GUI, command lines, UI, tooling

#### File System

- Storage is mostly blocks of bytes
- File system is an abstraction
- How files stored on disk
- btrfs, ext4, fat32, NTFS, tmpfs

#### Program vs Process

- Program is the compiled executable
- Process is an instance of the program
- Process is an program in motion
- Execution file format

#### Process Management

- Kernel managess processes
- Schedules process for a CPU
- Switches a process for another
- Grant access to resources like storage

#### User space vs Kenel space

- User space: Browser, Db
- Protected kernel space: Kernel code, device drivers, TCP/IP stack
- Isolated

#### Device Drivers

- Drivers are software in the kernel
- Manages hardware devices
- NVMe, Keyboard, NIC, etc...
- Interrupt Service Routine

#### System Calls

- To jump from User to Kernel mode
- User makes a system call
- read(), write(), malloc()
- Mode switch
